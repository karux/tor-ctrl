# tor-ctrl

command-line Tor controller written in bash

This is only a backup from [torproject.org svn](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/branches/hidserv-perf/contrib/tor-ctrl.sh).

No development/maintenance planed. Please feel free to fork and/or take over development/maintenance.

# extra: man page
This is just a bonus. Feel free to ignore.

To view the man page, either just open it in an editor or preview it with the [ruby-ronn](https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn) ([in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=ruby-ronn)).

    ronn --man tor-ctrl.8.ronn

To convert it into roff, so a proper man page can be created.

    ronn --roff tor-ctrl.8.ronn
